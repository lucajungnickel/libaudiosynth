# libaudiosynth
A lightweight and small audio synthesizing library for creating additive sounds in C

Usage:

There is a demo file: main.c. It will create an exponential ADSR envelope and will add this to some sine fifths with the base frequency of 50Hz. It will write the output to a output.wav file.
